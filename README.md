CS 403: Introduction To Robotics Project
- Programmed in C a GUI autonomous interaction of two identical robot players called Roger playing ping pong, where Roger detects, chases, and punches the ball to win points when the ball hits the back end of the opposing Roger's field
- Applied mathematics and physics for the inverse kinematics process of a calculating the constantly changing elbow, shoulder, and base angles and coordinates of a robot in relation to the ball it's trying to hit in the virtual environment
